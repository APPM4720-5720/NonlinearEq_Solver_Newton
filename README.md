# NonlinearEq_Solver_Newton

There are three versions of pretty much the same code here, which is Newton's method for finding the roots of nonlinear equations. None of the methods approximate the derivative/partial derivatives numerically, instead the exact values are calculated by hand. Feel free to add and make corrections or comments! I didn't check if any of the system calculations were correct, just modified the original version to include the Jacobian, vector function, norm, etc. More notes are included in comments within the code.

- NonlinearEq_Solver_Newton.py solves for the roots of one nonlinear equation with Newton's method.

- NonlinearSyst_Solver_Newton.py solves for the roots of a system of nonlinear equations with Newton's Method.

- ChenEq_Solver_Newton.py is and updated version of NonlinearSyst_Solver_Newton.py that solves three equations, namely Chen's Equations.
